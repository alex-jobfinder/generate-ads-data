Act as a senior reviewer. Review this PR:

{{diff_or_link}}

Evaluate and comment on:
- Correctness & test coverage (missing cases?)
- Complexity & readability
- Performance & allocations
- Security, privacy, and secrets handling
- Observability (logs/metrics/traces)
- API & schema compatibility
Provide specific inline comments and suggested patches.

Additionally check:
- Supply chain: dependency updates, SBOM/license compliance, vulnerability scans
- Secret scanning and config hygiene (no secrets in code or logs)
- Backward/forward compatibility and migration safety (zero-downtime, idempotency)
- Logging quality: structured, correlation IDs, no sensitive data in logs
