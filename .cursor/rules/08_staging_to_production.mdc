Create a deployment checklist for **{{feature}}** across {{envs}}.

Include:
- Pre-deployment checks (migrations, feature flags, config)
- Smoke tests & data backfills (if any)
- Rollout plan (canary/gradual), rollback steps
- Monitoring & alerting: {{monitors}}
- Success/failure criteria and on-call handoff notes
Keep it concise and immediately actionable.

Pre-deploy checklist (expand as needed):
- Schema/migrations applied in staging; backups verified; feature flags default safe
- Config and secrets validated; runbook and rollback documented; access reviewed

Rollout safety:
- Canary thresholds (e.g., error rate, p95 latency, saturation); auto-rollback criteria and steps
- Post-deploy verification queries/checks and dashboards to review
