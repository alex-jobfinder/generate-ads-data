From the approved design:

{{design_doc}}

Produce **subsystem docs**, one per component, with:
- Purpose & responsibilities
- Public APIs (request/response JSON, status codes, versioning, idempotency, pagination, rate limits, error schema)
- Data models & storage choices
- Dependencies & contracts
- Observability (logs, metrics, traces) with named fields/metrics and trace spans
- Testing strategy (unit/integration/contract)
- Ownership handoff notes
Keep each subsystem doc compact and copy-pastable to wiki.

If persistent storage is involved, include:
- Migration/backfill plan, rollback steps, zero-downtime approach
- Data retention/classification, access controls, and audit logging
