Convert these subsystem docs into **Jira-style backlog items**:

{{subsystem_docs}}

For each item include:
- Title
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria (Gherkin if useful)
- Definition of Done (includes docs updated and telemetry shipped)
- Dependencies
- Estimate (S/M/L) and suggested ordering for a {{sprint_length}}-day sprint
Keep tasks small (≤ 1–2 days each).

Additionally require per item:
- Risk label (Low/Medium/High) and mitigation/owner
- Test coverage target and evidence (unit/integration/contract as applicable)
- Feature flag or config toggle (if user-visible or risky)
