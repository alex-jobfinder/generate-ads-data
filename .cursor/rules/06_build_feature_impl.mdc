Implement the feature in **{{language}}** to satisfy these tests:

{{tests}}

Follow:
- Clean architecture, dependency injection where helpful
- Performance & memory awareness
- Clear errors, logging, and metrics (structured logs, correlation IDs)
- Small, composable functions; docstrings; typing

Return complete source files ready to drop into a repo.

Operational requirements:
- Configuration via environment/config files; no secrets in code; secret manager integration where applicable
- Zero-downtime migrations and idempotent jobs/tasks; clear rollback steps
- Backward/forward compatibility for APIs and schemas; explicit versioning
- Reject use of ad-hoc print logging; use structured logging and consistent error handling
