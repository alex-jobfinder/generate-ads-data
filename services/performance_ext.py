"""
Extended performance generation with Pydantic models for calculated fields.

This module extends the basic performance data with Pydantic models that compute
derived metrics from raw data. It does NOT generate new data - it only adds
calculated fields to existing performance data.

NETFLIX CORE ADVERTISING METRICS (as documented by Netflix):
- Impressions: Total ad impressions served
- Clicks: Total click-through interactions  
- CTR: Click-through rate (clicks/impressions)
- Video Completion Rate: Percentage of video ads completed
- Render Rate: Percentage of ads that rendered successfully
- Fill Rate: Percentage of ad requests that were filled
- Response Rate: Interactive engagement rate
- Video Skip Rate: Percentage of video ads skipped
- Video Start: Number of video ads that began playing

Design:
- NO data generation - uses existing performance data
- Pydantic computed fields for all derived metrics
- Adds calculated fields to existing performance rows
- Follows Netflix's documented metric definitions and ranges.

# ===== NETFLIX CORE ADVERTISING METRICS MAPPING =====
# 
# This module now focuses on computing derived metrics from existing performance data.
# The core metrics follow Netflix's definitions and are computed using Pydantic models:
#
# 1. Impressions: Total ad impressions served (from existing data)
# 2. Clicks: Total click-through interactions (from existing data)
# 3. CTR: Click-through rate (clicks/impressions) - COMPUTED FROM EXISTING DATA
# 4. Video Completion Rate: Via q100 quartile (10%-70% completion) - COMPUTED FROM EXISTING DATA
# 5. Render Rate: Via viewability (95%-99% typical for Netflix) - COMPUTED FROM EXISTING DATA
# 6. Fill Rate: Via supply funnel (85%-98% typical) - COMPUTED FROM EXISTING DATA
# 7. Response Rate: Interactive engagement (1%-5% typical) - COMPUTED FROM EXISTING DATA
# 8. Video Skip Rate: Video skips (10%-40% typical) - COMPUTED FROM EXISTING DATA
# 9. Video Start: Video begins (70%-99% of impressions) - COMPUTED FROM EXISTING DATA
#
# All metrics are computed from existing performance data, eliminating duplication.
