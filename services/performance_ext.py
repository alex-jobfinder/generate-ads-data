"""
Extended performance generation utilities (hourly, campaign-level) for Netflix Ads.

NETFLIX CORE ADVERTISING METRICS (as documented by Netflix):
- Impressions: Total ad impressions served
- Clicks: Total click-through interactions  
- CTR: Click-through rate (clicks/impressions)
- Video Completion Rate: Percentage of video ads completed
- Render Rate: Percentage of ads that rendered successfully
- Fill Rate: Percentage of ad requests that were filled
- Response Rate: Interactive engagement rate
- Video Skip Rate: Percentage of video ads skipped
- Video Start: Number of video ads that began playing

Design:
- No strict asserts/order constraints; values are clipped to non-negative.
- Mostly derive counts; compute rates downstream.
- Deterministic with seed.
- Follows Netflix's documented metric definitions and ranges.

# ===== NETFLIX CORE ADVERTISING METRICS MAPPING =====
# 
# This module generates synthetic performance data that aligns with Netflix's 
# documented advertising platform capabilities. The core metrics follow Netflix's
# definitions and typical ranges:
#
# 1. Impressions: Total ad impressions served (1000-10000 base, scaled by factors)
# 2. Clicks: Total click-through interactions (0.1%-2% CTR typical)
# 3. CTR: Click-through rate (clicks/impressions)
# 4. Video Completion Rate: Via q100 quartile (10%-70% completion)
# 5. Render Rate: Via viewability (95%-99% typical for Netflix)
# 6. Fill Rate: Via supply funnel (85%-98% typical)
# 7. Response Rate: Interactive engagement (1%-5% typical)
# 8. Video Skip Rate: Video skips (10%-40% typical)
# 9. Video Start: Video begins (70%-99% of impressions)
#
# All metrics include realistic seasonal variations (hour-of-day, day-of-week,
# flight ramp, annual seasonality) and follow Netflix's documented ranges.
# Extended metrics beyond the core 9 are also generated for comprehensive analysis.
