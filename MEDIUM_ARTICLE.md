## üöÄ Generating Netflix Ads Data

### Quick Start: Generate Everything

```bash
# Generate complete dataset in one command
./run_all.sh
```

This single command creates:
- 3 Complete Examples (Luxury Auto, Crunchy Snacks, NexBank)
- 4 Campaign Profiles (High CPM, Mobile, Interactive, Multi-device)
- 7 Strategic Profiles (Gain Market Share vs Defend Market Share)
- Performance data for all campaigns (6,000+ rows)

### Step-by-Step Generation

#### 1. Create Examples

```bash
# Create luxury auto awareness campaign
python cli.py create-example \
  --template cli_templates/examples/netflix-ads-examples.yml \
  --example luxury_auto_awareness

# Create crunchy snacks consideration campaign
python cli.py create-example \
  --template cli_templates/examples/netflix-ads-examples.yml \
  --example crunchy_snacks_consideration

# Create NexBank conversion campaign
python cli.py create-example \
  --template cli_templates/examples/netflix-ads-examples.yml \
  --example nexbank_conversion
```

#### 2. Create Campaign Profiles

```bash
# High CPM TV awareness campaigns
python cli.py create-profile --name high_cpm_tv_awareness

# Mobile consideration campaigns
python cli.py create-profile --name mobile_consideration

# Interactive conversion campaigns
python cli.py create-profile --name conversion_interactive

# Multi-device advanced campaigns
python cli.py create-profile --name multi_device_advanced
```

#### 3. Create Strategic Profiles

```bash
# Gain Market Share: Expansion campaigns
python cli.py create-profile --name high_cpm_tv_awareness
python cli.py create-profile --name mobile_consideration
python cli.py create-profile --name conversion_interactive

# Defend Market Share: Retention campaigns
python cli.py create-profile --name high_cpm_tv_awareness
python cli.py create-profile --name mobile_consideration
python cli.py create-profile --name conversion_interactive
python cli.py create-profile --name multi_device_advanced
```

### What Gets Generated

Each campaign creates:
- **Advertiser** with realistic company details
- **Campaign** with targeting and budget
- **Line Items** with ad formats and placements
- **Creatives** with video specs and interactive elements
- **Performance Data** (hourly metrics for 7+ days)
- **Extended Metrics** (viewability, completion rates, audience insights)

## üîç Querying Your Data

### Understanding Your Database Schema

Before diving into queries, let's understand the database structure. The platform creates a comprehensive schema with realistic Netflix ads data:

![Database Entity Relationship Diagram showing table relationships](ads_db__erd_sqlite_cursor.JPG)

**Key Table Relationships:**
- **`advertisers`** ‚Üí **`campaigns`** (one-to-many)
- **`campaigns`** ‚Üí **`line_items`** (one-to-many) 
- **`campaigns`** ‚Üí **`creatives`** (one-to-many)
- **`campaigns`** ‚Üí **`performance`** (one-to-many)
- **`campaigns`** ‚Üí **`performance_ext`** (one-to-many)

**What Each Table Contains:**
- **`advertisers`**: Company information, industry, brand details
- **`campaigns`**: Campaign objectives, budgets, targeting, status
- **`line_items`**: Ad formats, placements, delivery settings, targeting JSON
- **`creatives`**: Video specs, interactive elements, QA status, file properties
- **`performance`**: Hourly metrics (impressions, clicks, spend, CTR, CPM)
- **`performance_ext`**: Extended metrics (viewability, completion rates, supply funnel)

### Opening Your Database in Cursor

1. **Open the database file**:
   - Right-click on `ads.db` in Cursor's file explorer
   - Select "Open With..." ‚Üí "SQLite3 Editor"

2. **Explore the schema**:
   - Tables are automatically loaded in the left sidebar
   - Click on any table to see its structure and sample data
